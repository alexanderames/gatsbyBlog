#New Work

My newest work, you're looking at! This blog is written in Gatsby, [check out my repo](https://github.com/alexanderames/gatsbyBlog), and I took great pride in making it. I am also proud of a [Rails API](https://github.com/alexanderames/bcc-api) I built. Originally I created it for a coding challenge but I decided to go back and fully vet my ideas. It is connected to a [React app that I made from scratch](https://github.com/alexanderames/bcc). The user experience leaves something to be desired but the backend code is well thought out.

#Old Work

Nevertheless, it's been a good learning experience. Being able to go through my old code and check out some of the  techniques I hadn't quite picked up yet. My ability to make consistent CSS is lacking. The UI in general is elementary. Despite those shortcomings I still managed to throw together user authentication, to sign into the some of the applications. I also created a shopping cart and a way to filter posts by use of hash tags. At the time I thought that these things were impossible but now its something I incorporate everyday at work.

##Cheers!

On a final note, I made this blog so that employers who ask for more than a GitHub and LinkedIn account can come here and get all that and much more! I hope you enjoyed walking down memory lane with me. I look forward to writing more as the days go on :)
