#Oh, hello.

 I've been wanting to make a blog for awhile now but never had the chance. The toughest part was what to make the blog about. Should it be tech (write what I know)? Or should it be purely, Journal-related, writing posts? Politics? Religion? I finally decided.. Why not everything!

##Software

I love what I do. I started my software development career roughly 4 yrs ago when I found out my wife was pregnant. I was working at a computer repair shop when we got the wonderful news and I thought to myself, *damn I need to get a real job*. So I began coding in my free time. I instantly fell in love with it. Working around hardware all day, the biggest set back was the limitation to it all. A soldering iron, logic board, screw driver, etc., it was all too confining. With software, the sky is the limit (not really, there are servers involved and whatnot, but you get the idea). I began creating one app after another and the rest, as they say, is history.

##Home

I am married with two young daughters, who are 1 & 3 yrs old. We live in Denver, CO and I don't think we are ever leaving. Originally from Phoenix, AZ, I can not take the heat anymore and welcome the snowy winters of the Rockies. I am currently in the process of trying to buy a "rolling-home", (pictures to follow). What I mean by rolling-home is a motor vehicle that you can sleep in, which can be anything from a Class-C RV to a conversion van.

###What to expect..

Like I mentioned previously, I plan to write: extremely personal entries, technical write-ups, and all the comedic bits'n'bobs that make up this beautiful life I live. If you made it this far, hat's off amigo!
